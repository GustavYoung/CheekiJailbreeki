# CheekiJailbreeki
A 10.2.1 jailbreak for 64-bit devices, for all squatters and communists

*Please note: this is work in progress adopted into a xCode project with the right linker settings so it is easier to compile into an iPhone app for anyone but mainly meant for developers until it's finished.

# Compilation instructions
- Download the project
- Go into the triple_fetch folder

      cd triple_fetch_sdk
      ./build.sh
      cp ziva1 ../nsxpc2pc
      cp ziva1 ../nsxpc2pc/pocs/
      open ../nsxpc2pc.xcodeproj
      
# Problem Solving
- Plug in your iDevice (Make Sure it is NOT Locked!)
- Goto Window->Devices
- Wait for the symbols to load
- Make Sure To CHANGE your Signing team AND the name of the app id to something unique.
- Example (com.cyka.blyat -> com.cyka.blyat.rashb)
- Make sure you have provisioning profiles
- Compile for the device plugged in instead of simulator
- PROFIT??!!

# To do
- Fix the yalu102 offsets
- Make the output of ziVA log to the debugger
- Make the world communistic
- For some reason my songs don't play random. Fix it and get credited. (:D)

# Extra
- If you have libimobiledevice installed you can run the debug-iphone to get a bit more debug output
- If you have libimobiledevice installed you can run reboot-iphone to restart your iphone when the exploit fails
